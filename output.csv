StingRay 5 35th Anniversary,basses/stingray-5-35th-anniversary,"
In 1987 Ernie Ball Music Man created the legendary StingRay 5 bass, setting the standard for the modern 5-string bass. The 35th Anniversary edition honors the timeless Ernie Ball Music Man design that has been used by some of the world’s most iconic bassists. The ash body features a spalted maple top with thin maple veneer and comes standard with a Spalted Sunburst finish. The roasted figured maple neck features an ebony fretboard, copper pearlescent block inlays and is finished in a high gloss for superb comfort and playability. High-output neodymium StingRay 5 pickups provide powerful low-end with a distinctive mid-range punch while the lightweight hardware delivers solid stability. Limited to 225 single-humbucker and 25 dual-humbucker models, every Anniversary StingRay 5 includes a certificate of authenticity.

Short Scale StingRay,basses/short-scale-stingray,"
The Ernie Ball Music Man Short Scale StingRay bass offers a big thumpy round sound in a convenient smaller package. A 30” scale allows for easier playability due to the shorter spacing between the frets. The Ernie Ball Music Man passive humbucking pickup, equipped with higher output neodymium magnets, has been specially designed for the short scale bass, providing its signature warm tone. The electronics package includes a 3-way rotary switch featuring parallel, true single-coil, and series modes. Like its big brother, the Stingray Special, the short scale bass comes standard with a modern classic bridge, 22 stainless steel frets, and new lightweight Music Man tuning machines with a finer gear ratio.

Tim Commerford,basses/tim-commerford,"
Welcome to the Tim Commerford Artist Series StingRay collection. These brand-new limited-edition Ernie Ball Music Man instruments were designed in conjunction with Tim Commerford, the legendary bassist of Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave, and his newest project, 7D7D. Tim has been a part of the Ernie Ball Music Man family for many years, and this collaboration is the natural evolution of his enduring passion for the StingRay bass. With active and passive options for both short-scale and full-scale, you’re sure to find the right match for your playing style. The passive full-scale and active short-scale models deserve special consideration, as Music Man has never before offered these configurations.

Over the last 30 years, Commerford has perfected his signature sound, playing many passive and active basses. The ability to have both full and short-scale, active and passive basses in one collection gives Tim the tools required to reproduce the sounds made famous throughout his career.

Cliff Williams,basses/cliff-williams,"
The all-new Cliff Williams Icon Series StingRay Bass is the first in a series of limited handcrafted replicas made to capture the look, sound, and essence of iconic Music Man instruments. Initially dubbed “The #1 Workhorse,” Cliff's 1979 Stingray has been his favorite bass for more than 40 years. Built to the exacting specifications of his original, every detail and characteristic was carefully examined and addressed. Body contours, neck carve, pickup construction, and decades of wear and tear were dutifully replicated by Music Man’s team of master craftsmen. The resulting outcome is a finely crafted period-correct instrument that looks, feels, and sounds just like Cliff’s #1 Stingray bass.
Only 26 available worldwide.
