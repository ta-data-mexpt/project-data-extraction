# Project: API and Web Data Scraping

## Overview

The goal of this project is to practice what I have learned in the APIs and Web Scraping chapter of this program.

I tried at first workign with amazon and spotify API but ended up being blocked by both pages. Therefore, I ended doing an analysis of a bass webpage to see what will be the next bass I want to buy, their characteristics and what option suits me best. 

Since I had several attempts for this project there are improvements to be done for the version 2.0 of the bass analysis:
* Clean the database
* Access the contained links that have families within the basses
