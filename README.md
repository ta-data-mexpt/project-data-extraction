# Project: API and Web Data Scraping



The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

* **Code Approach** I decided to do a web scrapping of Cravioto's e-shop, which is a tools and building supplies store. The web site is an html web site. Because of the structure of the labels I thought that was an accurate site to scrap, according what we learned in the bootcamp.
* The output I got from the web scrapping are the name of the product, the price and the picture link.
* As a feauture for this web scrapping is to get the "SKU code" and the "Users opinions", in which I have to open the link of each product and scrap them.

* **Results** As I though in the beginning I found out some issues by doing the scrapping. I got in a .CSV file the results of the web scrapping to this page. I would like the page had more data to scrap and practice more. But because the lack of time and some changes to my master plan, I couldn't. 

* One of my main issues were to define clear and precisely my action plan. I think that it was the principal task to solve, but is better to have a good action plan before starting. Definitly that saved me hour of work.
* The second important issue is that i couldn't scrap the URL images of each product, I had been having troubles trying to call the right label. Feedback is welcome.


* **Lessons learned** 
* The first one I want to writte about is of hard skills because I could do a reinforcement to my already knowledge, specially in OOP. I understood the theme when we did the lab, but when I tried to this project I found that I had a lot of opportunity areas to work.

* The second lesson I had is about soft skills. If you wrote a code and you think you can use it, do it. After hours trying to wrtie by myself the code, I recall to take a look at the labs I had solved and I found that would be easier to copy the structure of another one instead trying to do everything from the start.

* Finally I can say that even I could save hours tryi
