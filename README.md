# Project: API and Web Data Scraping

## Overview

The following project which I called Scrapper, uses the Wiki API's for listing the details of a Fortune 500 company. The output will be contained in a .json file, the larger the number of companies that you choose, the larger the output of the file will be. For this particular case I chose 50 companies from the top 500 list.

I called the listed details as wiki_data and contains several key components suchs as the founder, net worth, equity, HQ and so on. Based that this project is linked to the Fortune 500 the number of companies is limited, however, obtaining a wiki_data page from say, like a football player would also be possible, provided the API worked at the same level. It was a fun project! Had to read a lot but I enjoyed it nonetheless :).
