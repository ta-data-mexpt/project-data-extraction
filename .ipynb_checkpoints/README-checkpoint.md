This project was a great challenge and achievement for me, since it was individual and I tried to push myself to the next level integrating Selenium.
I decided to retrieve data by scraping an educational resource web page (https://www.oercommons.org/).
My biggest challenge was interacting with the web page via Selenium. I tried to apply the filters the web page's search engine had available without success. However, it was very interesting getting to know different techniques to make a more accurate interaction, like WebDriverWait, using XPATH, ActionsChains, among others. Also, it made me practice and realize the importance of administering your time and working on a deliverable that may not be your dream result, but solves what you need to do and meets quality standards. Finally, synthetizing the code into functions represented a challenge for me, since I am still working on the understanding of functions and requires a lot of attention to detail, understanding of your own code, and knowing how to read errors in order to be successful.
