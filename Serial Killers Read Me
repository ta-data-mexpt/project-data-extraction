# Project: API and Web Data Scraping
Paola Franco Septiembre 2020 DAPT, MÃ©xico, 22/11/2020

## Overview

To collect information of the serial killers with the highest victim count, I used Wikipedia to scrap the information. To have further insights on each serial killer, I used the "Data News" API to find a news article where the topic is the serial killer. As a result, the information is saved as a CSV file to future analysis. 

Web scraping: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_serial_killers_by_number_of_victims"
API: https://datanews.io/


## Workflow
Before coding, there was a brainstorming process on what information the final data frame should include. Once that was determined, both the website to scrap and the API, were selected. More detailed steps below:

1. Draw a chart to have a very clear concept on what the outcome should be. 

2. Select the website to scrape.

3. Start web scrapping process. 

4. Once data was clean, a dataframe was created.

5. As a complement of the project, an API was included. 

6. With the data that was pulled from the API, another dataframe was created. 

7. To have the final data, a join of both dataframes was executed. 

8. Finally, the data was saved as a CSV file. 


The main challenges for this code were: 

1. Cleaning the data: identifying how to fix the index 31 that was the only one that did not follow the initial cleaning logic. 

2. Simplifying the code: find a more efficient and simple way to run the code; apply the zen of Python principles. 

3. Building the pipeline: once I had the code running, it was confusing how to build the functions. 



## Lessons learned 

* **Be explicit when coding, sometimes you forget your own code if you are not clear. 

* **Going through documentation, class examples or any other additional material it is also a way to brainstorm. It is useful to figure out things differently. 

* **Have an order when coding. Follow a mental model that guides you step by step.
